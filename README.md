# ROBLOX API Dump Tool
A tool I made to help me keep track of upcoming ROBLOX features, and API changes that I need to document on the ROBLOX Wiki.

With this program you can: 
* View the current version's API Dump, as well as the API Dumps on gametest1-gametest5
* Fetch API Dumps without switching the version that your game client is on
* See the differences between the API Dump on roblox.com, and the API Dump on one of the gametest sites (in a similar manner to anaminus.github.io/api)

All of the files present in the master folder of this repository need to be present (except for the src folder) in order for the program to work correctly.
Enjoy ;)
