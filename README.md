# Roblox API Dump Tool
A tool I made to help me keep track of upcoming Roblox features, and API changes that I need to document on the Roblox Wiki.

With this program you can: 
* View the current version's API Dump, as well as the API Dumps on gametest1-gametest5
* Fetch API Dumps without switching the version that your game client is on
* See the differences between the API Dump on roblox.com, and the API Dump on one of the gametest sites (in a similar manner to http://anaminus.github.io/api)

All of the files present in the master folder of this repository need to be present (except for the src folder) in order for the program to work correctly.

Enjoy ;)

# Notes about Roblox's Update Pipeline

* API changes go through a testing pipeline before they reach production.
 * Specifically: gametest2 -> gametest1 -> production
* gametest3-gametest5 are used for features that aren't ready for production, but could use some developer testing none-the-less.
